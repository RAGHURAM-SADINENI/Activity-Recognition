	i) Keep the mobile on a platform and record the activity in the app and name the file accordingly(1-2 mins).
	ii) Hold the mobile and record the activity while walking and name the file accordingly (1-2 mins).
	iii) Repeat the aboce activities for about 15-20 times.
3) Use the data from the files and use it for training and testing:
	i) KNN
	ii) Decission tree
	iii) Neural networks
	iv) KMeans
	v)Random Forests
4) Record a new activity and use the models built to classify the type of activity.
